## Functions 

1.) Admin has the previlage to manage the meetings 
2.) Add/EDIT/Delete New Meetings  
3.) Guest only has a view listing  


## Things I did and I wanted to do if more time

1.) I've created 1 vue component to manage the bookings and created variables to play around. 

2.) I might also be like to transfer all code in the controller to request container so all controllers is neat and tidy.   

But that's it for now. Thank you.
