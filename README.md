## Things I did and I wanted to do if more time

1.) I've created 1 vue component to manage the bookings and created variables to play around. 

2.) I've would like as well play around in the user permission which I wanted to keep more safe. right now, I did was to make sure that admin and user are having permission correct. 

3.) I have a missing features which I dont have on the code because I already consume 6 hours.

4.) I might also be like to transfer all code in the controller to request container so all controllers is neat and tidy.
